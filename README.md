# Terminal Password Manager
A very primitive password manager. Complete with secure log in, options for generation, encryption of generated passwords, viewing of regular and encrypted passwords along with the email, username, and website!

[INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE]

1. ONLY RUN PassManager.exe, the other exe's are necessary but will not function properly if ran by themselves, IGNORE THEM (I'm bad at coding lol)

2. All other instructions are stated in the program, enjoy :)

NOTES:

Do not attempt to run pass_generator.exe or stored_passwords.exe before running PassManager.exe at least once. THEY WILL CRASH

If you are launching the exe, make sure to add "\Applications" to the file path, Windows will not do this automatically, and "\Source Code" if you are launching from the .py's
